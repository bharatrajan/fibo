## Simple fibonacci number generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence `F(n)` can be defined by:

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2
```

A new service that allows users to compute the fibonacci number of a given input at super fast speeds. A minimal interface, that allows a user to input a number, and view the output (the nth fibonacci number).
